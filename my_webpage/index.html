                  <h4>Stories of a League of Legend Character: ZED</h4>
                  <p>
                    I love playing league of legend but I am more interested in the stories. It is a very interesting fiction story. Zed as a shadow master and an assassin abandoned his master and went on a dark trip because he was changed because of a spell.

                  <h4>Doubt About Anime and Real Life:</h4>
                  <p>
                    My favorite anime is DragonBall. It is a fictional anime about an alien coming to take over and destroy our planet earth but turns out to be a protector of the earth. The doubt is: there have been people coming from the future and the past. These change the time and sometimes break the time zone. How exactly do these things work and even in real life?

            <span>League of Legend is one of the most popular games all over the world. However, not just playing it, the fictional stories behind it and how each champion came from can be extremely interesting and amazing to explore.</span>

                <h4>How Zed Become An Assassin</h4>
                <p>
                  Zed is an orphan, who got adopted by a ninja master. He trains with master's son, Shen but quickly develops jealousy since Zed can't beat Shen. Zed, due to desperation and jealousy opened a dark energy sealed box. There comes the shadow master assassin, Zed.

                <h4>The Death of Zed's Master</h4>
                <p>
                  Zed always tried to win master's son Shen but failed. After he got a secret dark power, Zed won Shen. However, the master realized he broke an evil spell so he banished Zed. As times goes, Zed become popular and has lots of disciples learning his shadow techiques. The master failure to lead his student to the right path decide to let Zed kill him.

                <h4>The Initialization of Rivalry Between Zed and Shen</h4>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, Shen, master's son heard about the killing of his dad by Zed's hand. That begin Shen's rival against Zed. Shen then saved a lot of other master's students and become a heroic symbol. On the other hand, Zed covered the temple where he found the box with shadow powers and kill anyone who do not embrace them.

                <h4>Zed's Words</h4>
                <p>
                  Zed's famous saying: "Balance is a lie - we are the true ninjas." Denying what the master teaches him and gaining shadow power, Zed believed that all equality and justice are obsolete about ninjas. Not only that, he said:"perfect one's technique, and kill all ninjas who refuse to embrace the shadows." Zed wants his shadow to be known by everyone and get rid of any who oppose to his powerful technique.
